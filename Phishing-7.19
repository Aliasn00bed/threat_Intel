Below is a low effort phishing e-mail I recieved today.  The domain is a gmail account which implies the person is either really dumb, or that account is a puppet/ is compromised.  The e-mail contained a faked Norton logo, which was very poorly done,
and a phone number written in bad ascii.  Reported it to google today as a phishing attempt.
